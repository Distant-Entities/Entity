Threads is the number of threads in the computer at the time of data collection. This is an instantaneous count, not an average over the time interval.  A thread is the basic executable entity that can execute instructions in a processor.
Datagrams Forwarded/sec is the rate, in incidents per second, at which attemps were made to find routes to forward input datagrams their final destination, because the local server was not the final IP destination. In servers that do not act as IP Gateways, this rate includes only packets that were source-routed via this entity, where the source-route option processing was successful.
Messages/sec is the total rate, in incidents per second, at which ICMP messages were sent and received by the entity. The rate includes messages received or sent in error.
Database Pages Repeatedly Written/sec is the rate that pages are written to the database file(s) from the database cache more than once in their lifetime in the cache.  These page writes represent extra writes above the theoretical minimum and can therefore be considered overhead.
Provides an estimate of the database cache lifetime, based on the most recently evicted resource.  A database page which is currently entering the cache should expect to remain in the cache for approximately this amount of time (in seconds) if not requested multiple times afterwards (i.e., if it doesn't become "hot").
